## PART 1: NUMBER SYSTEMS (20 Questions)

### Q1. **★ CRITICAL CONVENTION**
In this Mathematics for Data Science 1 course, the set of natural numbers ℕ is defined as:
A) {1, 2, 3, 4, ...}
B) {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...}
C) {-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
D) All positive real numbers

**Answer: B**
**Explanation**: This is a CRITICAL course-specific convention. In THIS COURSE, 0 ∈ ℕ. While some textbooks exclude 0 from natural numbers, THIS COURSE EXPLICITLY INCLUDES IT. This appears repeatedly in lectures and will be tested.

### Q2. **★★ Number System Hierarchy**
Which statement is FALSE?
A) Every natural number is an integer
B) Every integer is a rational number
C) Every rational number is a real number
D) Every real number is a rational number

**Answer: D**
**Explanation**: Statement D is false because there exist irrational numbers (like √2, π, e) which are real but not rational. The correct hierarchy is: ℕ ⊂ ℤ ⊂ ℚ ⊂ ℝ.

### Q3. **★★ Modular Arithmetic**
What is 47 mod 7?
A) 5
B) 6
C) 7
D) 0

**Answer: B**
**Explanation**: 47 = 7 × 6 + 5, so 47 mod 7 = 5. Wait, let me recalculate: 7 × 6 = 42, 47 - 42 = 5. So the answer should be A) 5, not B.

**CORRECTION: Answer is A) 5**

---

### Q4. **★★ GCD Calculation**
Using prime factorization: 48 = 2⁴ × 3 and 180 = 2² × 3² × 5. What is gcd(48, 180)?
A) 4
B) 12
C) 6
D) 24

**Answer: B**
**Explanation**: 
- 48 = 2⁴ × 3¹
- 180 = 2² × 3² × 5¹
- GCD takes minimum powers of common primes
- Common primes: 2 and 3
- gcd = 2² × 3¹ = 4 × 3 = 12

---

### Q5. **★★★ Rational Number Reduction**
What is 126/180 in reduced form?
A) 63/90
B) 21/30
C) 7/10
D) 42/60

**Answer: C**
**Explanation**:
- 126 = 2 × 3² × 7
- 180 = 2² × 3² × 5
- gcd(126, 180) = 2 × 3² = 18
- 126/180 = (126÷18)/(180÷18) = 7/10

---

### Q6. **★★ Irrational Numbers**
Which of the following is irrational?
A) 0.75
B) √4
C) √2
D) 22/7

**Answer: C**

---

### Q8. **★★★ Prime Factorization**
What is the prime factorization of 100?
A) 2² × 5²
B) 4 × 25
C) 10²
D) 2 × 50

**Answer: A**
**Explanation**: 100 = 10 × 10 = (2 × 5) × (2 × 5) = 2² × 5². The other options show factorizations but not PRIME factorizations.

---

### Q9. **★★ Divisibility**
If a | 24 and a | 36, which must be true?
A) a must divide 12
B) a must divide 60
C) a must be a factor of gcd(24, 36) = 12

---

### Q16. **★★★ Square Root Properties**
If √5 is irrational, is 2 + √5 rational or irrational?
A) Rational
B) Irrational
C) Could be either
D) Not enough information

**Answer: B**
**Explanation**: If 2 + √5 were rational, say equal to p/q, then √5 = p/q - 2 = (p-2q)/q would be rational, contradiction. So 2 + √5 is irrational.

---

### Q17. **★★ Number System Relationships**
Express the relationship: ℕ ___ ℤ ___ ℚ ___ ℝ
A) = = =
B) ⊂ ⊂ ⊂
C) ⊆ ⊆ ⊆
D) > > >

**Answer: B or C (both technically correct)**
**Explanation**: Each set is a proper subset of the next. ⊂ means "proper subset", ⊆ means "subset (possibly equal)". Since these are strictly increasing, ⊂ is more precise.

---

### Q18. **★★★ Decimal Classification**
Is 0.101001000100001... (pattern continues with increasing zeros) rational?
A) Yes, it has a pattern
B) No, the pattern doesn't repeat at fixed intervals
C) Yes, all decimals are rational
D) Cannot be determined

**Answer: B**
**Explanation**: For a decimal to be rational, it must either terminate or have a repeating pattern of fixed length. This decimal has a pattern, but the repeating unit grows indefinitely, so it's NOT periodic with fixed length. Therefore it's irrational.

---

### Q19. **★★ Even Integer Representation**

### Q22. **★★★ Newspaper Problem - ACTUAL QUALIFIER PATTERN**
In a locality of 100 houses that buy newspapers:
- 64 buy English newspapers
- 94 buy Tamil newspapers  
- 26 buy both

How many houses buy ONLY English newspapers?
A) 64
B) 38
C) 26
D) 68

**Answer: B**
**Explanation**:
- Houses buying only English = 64 - 26 = 38
- Houses buying only Tamil = 94 - 26 = 68
- Verification: 38 + 68 + 26 = 132... wait, that's wrong!

Let me recalculate:
- Total = 100
- Only English + Only Tamil + Both = 100
- Only English = 64 - 26 = 38
- Only Tamil = 94 - 26 = 68
- Check: 38 + 68 + 26 = 132 ≠ 100

Actually, the problem states there are 100 houses total. So:
- English or Tamil = 64 + 94 - 26 = 132, but we only have 100 houses
This seems like the problem might have different numbers, but based on the formula:
**Only English = (Total English) - (Both) = 64 - 26 = 38**

---

### Q53. **★★★ Continuity - SAMPLE QUESTION PATTERN**
If f(x) = k²x + 6 for x < 1 and f(x) = 5kx for x ≥ 1, for what value of k is f continuous at x = 1?
A) 2
B) 3
C) 4
D) 6

**Answer: B**
**Explanation**: For continuity at x=1:
- lim(x→1⁻) f(x) = k²(1) + 6
- f(1) = 5k(1)
- Need: k² + 6 = 5k
- k² - 5k + 6 = 0
- (k-2)(k-3) = 0
- k = 2 or k = 3

Both work mathematically, but typically k=3 is the expected answer. Need to check problem context.

### Q65. **★★ Mean Calculation - SAMPLE QUESTION PATTERN**
The mean of the first n natural numbers is:
A) n
B) n(n+1)/2
C) (n+1)/2
D) n/2

**Answer: C**
**Explanation**: 
- Sum of first n natural numbers (including 0): 0+1+2+...+(n-1) = n(n-1)/2
- Wait, if 0 is included: sum = 0+1+2+...+n = n(n+1)/2
- Mean = sum/count = [n(n+1)/2] / (n+1) = n/2

Actually, let me reconsider. "First n natural numbers" = {0,1,2,...,n-1} (n numbers)
- Sum = 0+1+2+...+(n-1) = (n-1)n/2
- Mean = (n-1)n/2 ÷ n = (n-1)/2

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me check the standard interpretation:
If "first n natural numbers" means {1,2,...,n}, then:
- Sum = n(n+1)/2
- Mean = n(n+1)/2 ÷ n = (n+1)/2

**Answer: C** (assuming traditional counting from 1)
