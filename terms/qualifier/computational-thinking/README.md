## Problem Decomposition

### 1.1 What is Problem Decomposition?

Problem decomposition is the process of breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable sub-problems that can be solved independently.

#### Key Principles
1. **Divide and Conquer**: Split large problems into smaller parts
2. **Modularity**: Create independent, reusable components
3. **Hierarchy**: Organize problems in levels from general to specific
4. **Clarity**: Make each sub-problem clear and well-defined

#### Benefits
- Makes complex problems manageable
- Enables parallel work on different parts
- Improves code reusability
- Facilitates debugging and testing
- Enhances team collaboration

### 1.2 Decomposition Strategies

#### Top-Down Approach
Start with the main problem and break it down into sub-problems.

**Example**: Planning a Birthday Party
```
Main Problem: Plan Birthday Party
├── Guest Management
│   ├── Create guest list
│   ├── Send invitations
│   └── Track RSVPs
├── Venue & Decorations
│   ├── Book venue
│   ├── Buy decorations
│   └── Set up space
├── Food & Drinks
│   ├── Plan menu
│   ├── Order/prepare food
│   └── Arrange beverages
└── Entertainment
    ├── Music playlist
    ├── Games/activities
    └── Photography
```

#### Bottom-Up Approach
Start with small components and combine them to solve larger problems.

**Example**: Building a Calculator
```
Basic Operations → Complex Functions → User Interface → Complete Calculator
(+, -, ×, ÷)   → (√, x², %)        → (Display, Buttons) → (Full Application)
```

### 1.3 Real-World Applications

#### Software Development
- **Web Application**: Frontend + Backend + Database
- **Mobile App**: UI Layer + Business Logic + Data Layer
- **Operating System**: Kernel + File System + User Interface

#### Project Management
- **Research Project**: Literature Review + Methodology + Data Collection + Analysis + Writing
- **Marketing Campaign**: Market Research + Strategy + Content Creation + Launch + Evaluation

#### Example: Online Learning Platform
```
Main System: Online Learning Platform
├── User Management System
│   ├── Registration/Login
│   ├── User profiles
│   └── Authentication
├── Course Management System
│   ├── Course creation
│   ├── Content upload
│   └── Progress tracking
├── Assessment System
│   ├── Quiz creation

## Pattern Recognition

### 2.1 Understanding Patterns

Pattern recognition involves identifying similarities, trends, and recurring elements in problems or data to develop general solutions.

#### Types of Patterns
1. **Structural Patterns**: How things are organized
2. **Behavioral Patterns**: How things change over time
3. **Functional Patterns**: How things work or relate
4. **Data Patterns**: Trends and relationships in data

### 2.2 Mathematical Patterns

#### Arithmetic Sequences
Pattern: Each term increases by a constant difference
```
Example: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, ...
Pattern: Add 3 to get the next term
Formula: an = a1 + (n-1)d, where d = common difference
```

#### Geometric Sequences
Pattern: Each term is multiplied by a constant ratio
```
Example: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, ...
Pattern: Multiply by 2 to get the next term
Formula: an = a1 × r^(n-1), where r = common ratio
```

#### Fibonacci Sequence
Pattern: Each term is the sum of the two preceding terms
```
Example: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
Pattern: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
```

### 2.3 Problem-Solving Patterns

#### Sorting Patterns
**Pattern**: Arrange items in order
**Applications**: 
- Alphabetizing names
- Organizing data
- Priority queues
- Search optimization

**Common Algorithms**:
- Bubble Sort: Compare adjacent elements
- Selection Sort: Find minimum, place at beginning
- Insertion Sort: Insert each element in correct position

#### Search Patterns
**Pattern**: Find specific items in collections
**Applications**:
- Database queries
- File searching
- Web search engines
- Route finding

**Strategies**:
- Linear Search: Check each item sequentially
- Binary Search: Divide and conquer (requires sorted data)
- Hash Tables: Direct access using keys

#### Example: Finding Maximum Value
```
Problem: Find the largest number in a list
Pattern: Compare and remember the largest seen so far

Algorithm:
1. Start with first number as maximum
2. Compare each remaining number with current maximum
3. If current number > maximum, update maximum
4. Return maximum after checking all numbers

Code Logic:
max = first_number
for each remaining_number:
    if remaining_number > max:
        max = remaining_number
return max
```

## Abstraction

### 3.1 What is Abstraction?

Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details while showing only essential features. It helps manage complexity by focusing on what something does rather than how it does it.

#### Levels of Abstraction
1. **Physical Level**: Hardware details
2. **Logical Level**: Data structures and algorithms
3. **View Level**: User interface and user experience

#### Benefits
- Reduces complexity
- Improves maintainability
- Enables code reuse
- Facilitates collaboration
- Allows focus on problem-solving

### 3.2 Data Abstraction

#### Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
Define what operations can be performed without specifying how they're implemented.

**Stack ADT**:
- Operations: push(), pop(), top(), isEmpty()
- Properties: Last In, First Out (LIFO)
- Implementation: Array or Linked List (hidden from user)

**Queue ADT**:
- Operations: enqueue(), dequeue(), front(), isEmpty()
- Properties: First In, First Out (FIFO)
- Implementation: Array or Linked List (hidden from user)

**Example: Bank Account ADT**
```
Operations:
- deposit(amount)
- withdraw(amount)
- getBalance()
- transfer(amount, destination)

User doesn't need to know:
- How balance is stored
- Database structure
- Security encryption
- Transaction logging
```

### 3.3 Functional Abstraction

Functions abstract complex operations into simple interfaces.

#### Example: Email System
```
High-level function: sendEmail(recipient, subject, message)

Hidden complexity:
- SMTP protocol handling
- Server connection management
- Message formatting
- Error handling
- Authentication
- Encryption
```

#### Mathematical Functions
```
Function: calculateArea(shape, dimensions)
- Circle: π × r²
- Rectangle: length × width
- Triangle: ½ × base × height

User just calls calculateArea("circle", radius)
Implementation details are hidden
```

### 3.4 Model Abstraction

#### Maps
- Abstract representation of geographic reality
- Show relevant features, hide unnecessary details
- Different abstractions for different purposes (road maps, topographic maps, subway maps)

#### Flowcharts
- Abstract representation of processes
- Show decision points and flow
- Hide implementation details

#### UML Diagrams
- Abstract representation of software systems
- Show relationships and interactions
- Multiple views for different stakeholders

## Algorithm Design

### 4.1 What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or completing a task. It must be:
- **Precise**: Each step clearly defined
- **Finite**: Must terminate after finite steps
- **Effective**: Each step must be executable
- **Input**: May take zero or more inputs
- **Output**: Must produce at least one output

### 4.2 Algorithm Design Strategies

#### Brute Force
Try all possible solutions until finding the correct one.

**Example**: Finding a password by trying all combinations
```
Algorithm: Password Cracking
1. Generate first possible password
2. Try password
3. If correct, stop; if not, generate next password
4. Repeat until password found

Pros: Simple, guaranteed to work
Cons: Very slow for complex problems
```

#### Divide and Conquer
Break problem into smaller sub-problems, solve recursively.

**Example**: Merge Sort
```
Algorithm: Merge Sort
1. If list has 1 or 0 elements, return (base case)
2. Divide list into two halves
3. Recursively sort each half
4. Merge the sorted halves

Time Complexity: O(n log n)
```

#### Greedy Approach
Make locally optimal choices at each step.

**Example**: Making Change
```
Problem: Give change for $0.67 using fewest coins
Coins available: quarters ($0.25), dimes ($0.10), nickels ($0.05), pennies ($0.01)

Greedy Algorithm:
1. Use as many quarters as possible: 2 quarters = $0.50, remaining = $0.17
2. Use as many dimes as possible: 1 dime = $0.10, remaining = $0.07
3. Use as many nickels as possible: 1 nickel = $0.05, remaining = $0.02
4. Use as many pennies as possible: 2 pennies = $0.02, remaining = $0.00

Result: 2 quarters + 1 dime + 1 nickel + 2 pennies = 6 coins
```

#### Dynamic Programming
Store solutions to sub-problems to avoid recalculation.

**Example**: Fibonacci Numbers
```
Naive Recursive: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
Problem: Recalculates same values multiple times

Dynamic Programming:
1. Create array to store results
2. Calculate F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
3. For i = 2 to n: F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2)
4. Return F(n)

Time Complexity: O(n) instead of O(2^n)
```

### 4.3 Algorithm Analysis

#### Time Complexity
How execution time grows with input size.

**Common Complexities**:
- O(1): Constant time
- O(log n): Logarithmic time
- O(n): Linear time
- O(n log n): Log-linear time
- O(n²): Quadratic time
- O(2ⁿ): Exponential time

#### Space Complexity
How memory usage grows with input size.

#### Example: Linear Search vs Binary Search
```
Linear Search:
- Time: O(n) - might check every element
- Space: O(1) - only need a few variables

Binary Search:
- Time: O(log n) - eliminate half each step
- Space: O(1) - only need a few variables
- Requirement: Data must be sorted
```

## Programming Logic

### 5.1 Logical Thinking

Programming requires breaking down problems into logical steps that a computer can execute.

#### Sequential Logic
Execute steps in order.
```
Example: Making Coffee
1. Fill kettle with water
2. Boil water
3. Add coffee to cup
4. Pour hot water into cup
5. Stir
6. Add milk/sugar if desired
```

#### Conditional Logic
Execute different steps based on conditions.
```
Example: Traffic Light Logic
if light is RED:
    stop
else if light is YELLOW:
    slow down and prepare to stop
else if light is GREEN:
    proceed with caution
```

#### Iterative Logic
Repeat steps until a condition is met.
```
Example: Reading a Book
while not finished_book:
    read next page
    if understand_page:
        continue to next page
    else:
        reread current page
```

### 5.2 Boolean Logic

#### Truth Values
- True (1): Condition is satisfied
- False (0): Condition is not satisfied

#### Logical Operators
- **AND**: Both conditions must be true
- **OR**: At least one condition must be true
- **NOT**: Reverses the truth value

#### Truth Tables
```
AND Truth Table:
A | B | A AND B
T | T |    T
T | F |    F
F | T |    F
F | F |    F

OR Truth Table:
A | B | A OR B
T | T |   T
T | F |   T
F | T |   T
F | F |   F

NOT Truth Table:
A | NOT A
T |   F
F |   T
```

#### Example: Student Admission Logic
```
Condition: Student is admitted if:
(GPA >= 3.5 AND SAT >= 1200) OR (GPA >= 4.0)

Logic:
if (gpa >= 3.5 and sat >= 1200) or (gpa >= 4.0):
    admission_status = "Admitted"
else:
    admission_status = "Not Admitted"
```
