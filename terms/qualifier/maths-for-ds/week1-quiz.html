                question: "In this Mathematics for Data Science 1 course, the set of natural numbers ℕ is defined as:",

                correctAnswer: 1,
                explanation: "This is a CRITICAL course-specific convention. In THIS COURSE, 0 ∈ ℕ. While some textbooks exclude 0 from natural numbers, THIS COURSE EXPLICITLY INCLUDES IT."

                correctAnswer: 3,
                explanation: "Statement D is false because there exist irrational numbers (like √2, π, e) which are real but not rational. The correct hierarchy is: ℕ ⊂ ℤ ⊂ ℚ ⊂ ℝ."

                correctAnswer: 0,

                correctAnswer: 1,
                explanation: "48 = 2⁴ × 3¹, 180 = 2² × 3² × 5¹. GCD takes minimum powers of common primes. Common primes: 2 and 3. gcd = 2² × 3¹ = 4 × 3 = 12"

                correctAnswer: 2,
                explanation: "√2 is irrational (proven by Hippasus around 500 BCE). The others: 0.75 = 3/4, √4 = 2, and 22/7 are all rational."

                correctAnswer: 0,
                explanation: "100 = 10 × 10 = (2 × 5) × (2 × 5) = 2² × 5². The other options show factorizations but not PRIME factorizations."

                correctAnswer: 2,
                explanation: "If a divides both 24 and 36, then a divides their GCD. gcd(24, 36) = 12, so a | 12."

                correctAnswer: 0,
                explanation: "Testing values: n = 23 satisfies both conditions: 23 mod 5 = 3 ✓ and 23 mod 7 = 2 ✓"

                correctAnswer: 2,
                explanation: "{-10, -9, -8, ..., 0, ..., 8, 9, 10} = 10 negative + 1 zero + 10 positive = 21"
